# Introduction

Welcome to the lecture materials for the course, B.Sc Mobile Robotics, held at MCI IV. This lecture covers a lot of topics
related to robotics, such as a brief introduction to the concept of robotics, their hardware, and a general overview on 
what kind of software we need to know to design robots.

> [!WARNING]
> This lecture assumes you are comfortable looking and writing C++. While the lecture covers C++
> as detaily as possible, If you need a refreshment, or want to study at your own pace,  please have a look at the 
> Cpp Lecture slides which covers the essential points you need to start ROS 2 programming ball rolling.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lecture is four (4) SWS and has **one assignment** and there will be no exam.

ALl lecture materials for this course will be published here. So please check here for most up-to-date material.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All .pdf files are password protected and to decrypt them, a password will be provided to you in SAKAI as an announcement.

> [!NOTE]
> This lecture will be predominantly self-studied. The initial lecture will follow a standard format and once
> the topic shifts focus to programming (i.e., Linux/ROS 2) you will follow curated documents with detailed instructions
> to learn by practice.

# Decrypting pdf with pdfDecryptor.py

If you want convenience and not having to constantly enter password to your.pdf files, then this file is for you. 

For easy use:

1. Download all material as a zip, and extract it to your location of choice.
2. Using the terminal of choice navigate to the directory.
3. Once in the directory, type the following into your terminal where password is given in SAKAI.

```
python3 pdfDecryptor.py "password"
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible (nay, very likely) need to install pikepdf to make this code work. For that type the following into your terminal.

```
pip3 install pikepdf
```

If your system give error about being external add ```--break-system-packages``` to the aforementioned command.
