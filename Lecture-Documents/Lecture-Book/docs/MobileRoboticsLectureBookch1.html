comes with options, and so the selection of a robot’s approach to locomotion is an important aspect of
mobile robot design. In laboratory settings, there are robots that can walk, jump, run, slide, swim, fly
and of course roll.

       the efficiency of wheeled locomotion depends on environmental qualities, such as the flatness and hardness of the ground, while the efficiency

      It is understandable therefore nature favours legged locomotion, as locomotion systems in nature must
     operate on rough and unstructured terrain. For example, in the case of insects in a forest the vertical

      A theoretical analysis of locomotion begins with mechanics and physics. From this starting point, we can
     formally define and analyse all manner of mobile robot locomotion systems. However, this Lecture Book puts
     more emphasis on the mobile robot navigation problem, particularly on the topics of perception, localisation
     and cognition. Therefore, we will not delve deeply into the physical basis of locomotion. Nevertheless, two
     remaining sections in this chapter present overviews of issues in legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion.

     For
     instance,
     in

     of
     the
     caterpillar,
     each
     leg
     is
     extended
     using
     hydraulic
     pressure
     by
     constricting
     the
     body
     cavity
     and
     forcing

     increase
     in
     pressure,
     and
     each
     leg
     is
     retracted
     longitudinally
     by
     relaxing
     the
     hydraulic
     pressure,
     then
     activating
     a
     single
     tensile
     muscle
     that
     pulls
     the
     leg
     in
     towards

     Forward
     locomotion
     depends
     on
     the
     hydraulic
     pressure
     in
     the
     body,
     which
     extends

     The

     The

     more

     by
     actuating

     of
     the
     foot.
     In

     adding
      <a class="glossary" href="MobileRoboticsLectureBookli2.html#glo:dof">
       DoF
      </a>
      to
     a
     robot
     leg

     on
     which
     it
     can

     the

     to
     travel
     with
     a
     variety

     The
     primary

     is,
     of

     and

      Four
     Legs
     (Quadruped)
     </h5>
     <p class="noindent">
      Although
     standing
     still
     on
     four
     legs
     is
     passively
     stable,
     walking
     remains
     challenging
     because
     to
     remain
     stable
     the
     robot’s
     center
     of
     gravity
     must
     be
     actively
     shifted
     during
     the
     gait.
     Sony
     recently
     invested
     several
     million
     dollars
     to
     develop
     a
     four-legged
     robot
     (figure
     2.14).
     To
     cre-
     ate
     this
     robot,
     Sony
     created
     both
     a
     new
     robot
     operating
     system
     that
     is
     near
     real-time
     and
     invented
     new
     geared
     servomotors
     that
     are
     sufficiently
     high
     torque
     to
     support
     the
     robot,
     yet
     backdriveable
     for
     safety.
     In
     addition
     to
     developing
     custom
     motors
     and
     software,
     Sony
     incorporated
     a
     color
     vision
     system
     that
     enables
     Aibo
     to
     chase
     a
     brightly
     colored
     ball.
     The
     robot
     is
     able
     to
     function
     for
     at
     most
     one
     hour
     before
     requiring
     recharging.
     Early
     sales
     of
     the
     robot
     have
     been
     very
     strong,
     with
     more
     than
     60,000
     units
     sold
     in
     the
     first
     year.
     Nevertheless,
     the
     number
     of
     motors
     and
     the
     technology
     investment
     behind
     this
     robot
     dog
     have
     resulted
     in
     a
     very
     high
     price
     of
     approximately
     1500.
     Four
     legged
     robots
     have
     the
     potential
     to
     serve
     as
     effective
     artifacts
     for
     research
     in
     human-
     robot
     interaction
     (fig.
     2.15).
     Humans
     can
     treat
     the
     Sony
     robot,
     for
     example,
     as
     a
     pet
     and
     might
     develop
     an
     emotional
     relationship
     similar
     to
     that
     between
     man
     and
     dog.
     Furthermore,
     Sony
     has
     designed
     Aibo’s
     walking
     style
     and
     general
     behavior
     to
     emulate
     learning
     and
     maturation,
     resulting
     in
     dynamic
     behavior
     over
     time
     that
     is
     more
     interesting
     for
     the
     owner
     who
     can
     track
     the
     changing
     behavior.
     As
     the
     challenges
     of
     high
     energy
     storage
     and
     motor
     technology
     are
     solved,
     it
     is
     likely
     that
     quadruped
     robots
     much
     more
     capable
     than
     Aibo
     will
     become
     common
     throughout
     the
     human
     environment.

      Six

     </h5>
     <p class="noindent">
      Six
     legged
     configurations
     have
     been
     extremely
     popular
     in
     mobile
     robotics
     because
     of
     their
     static
     stability
     during
     walking,
     thus
     reducing
     the
     control
     complexity
     (figure
     2.16
     and
     2.17).
     In
     most
     cases,
     each
     leg
     has
     3
     DOF,
     including
     hip
     flexion,
     knee

     rough
     terrain
     but
     performs
     quite
     well
     on
     flat
     ground.
     Because
     it
     consists
     of
     a
     straightforward
     arrangement
     of

     Insects,
     which
     are
     arguably
     the
     most
     successful
     locomoting
     creatures
     on

     excel
     at
     traversing

     forms
     of
     terrain
     with
     six
     legs,
     even
     upside
     down.
     Currently,
     the
     gap
     between
     the
     capabilities
     of
     six-legged
     insects
     and
     artificial
     six-legged
     robots
     is
     still
     quite
     large.
     Interestingly,
     this
     is
     not
     due
     to
     a
     lack
     of
     sufficient
     numbers
     of
     degrees
     of
     freedom
     on
     the
     robots.
     Rather,
     insects
     combine
     a
     small
     number
     of
     active
     degrees
     of
     freedom
     with
     passive
     structures,
     such
     as
     microscopic
     barbs
     and
     textured
     pads,
     that
     increase
     the
     gripping
     strength
     of
     each
     leg
     significantly.
     Robotic
     research
     into
     such
     passive
     tip
     structures
     has
     only
     recently
     begun.
     For
     example,
     a
     research
     group
     is
     attempting
     to
     recreate
     the
     complete
     mechanical
     function
     of
     the

     It
     is
     clear
     from
     all
     of
     the
     above
     examples
     that

     The

     the

     can

     move
     with
     very

     along
     many

     a

     often

     One

      Regardless

     normally
     required

     maintain
     wheel
     contact
     with
     the
     ground.
     One
     of
     the
     simplest
     approaches
     to
     suspension
     is
     to
     design
     flexibility
     into
     the
     wheel
     itself.
     For
     instance,
     in
     the
     case
     of
     some
     four-wheeled
     indoor
     robots
     that
     use
     castor
     wheels,
     manufacturers
     have
     applied
     a
     deformeable
     tire
     of
     soft
     rubber
     to
     the
     wheel
     in
     order
     to
     create
     a
     primitive
     suspension.
     Of
     course,
     this
     limited
     solution
     cannot
     compete
     with
     a
     sophisticated
     suspension
     system
     in
     applications
     where
     the
     robot
     needs

      Wheel  Geometry
     </h5>
     <p class="noindent">
      The choice of wheel types for a mobile robot is strongly linked to the choice of wheel arrangement, or wheel geometry.
     When designing a mobile robot locomotion we must consider these two <alert style="color: #821131;">(2)</alert>
     issues simultaneously. Why does wheel
     type and wheel geometry matter? Three fundamental characteristics of a robot are governed by these choices:

     example
     is
     Uranus,
     shown
     in
     figure
     2.24.
     This
     robot
     uses
     four
     swedish
     wheels
     to
     rotate
     and
     translate
     independently
     and
     without
     constraints.
     In
     general,
     the
     ground
     clearance
     of
     robots
     with
     swedish
     and
     spherical
     wheels
     is
     somewhat
     limited,
     due
     to
     the
     mechanical
     constraints
     of
     constructing
     omnidirectional
     wheels.
     An
     inter-
     esting
     recent
     solution
     to
     the
     problem
     of
     omnidirectional
     navigation
     while
     solving
     this
     ground
     clearance
     problem
     is
     the
     four
     castor-wheeled
     configuration
     in
     which
     each
     castor
     wheel
     is
     actively
     steered
     and
     actively
     translated.
     In
     this
     configuration,
     the
     robot
     is
     truly
     om-
     nidirectional
     because,
     even
     if
     the
     castor
     wheels
     are
     facing
     a
     direction
     perpendicular
     to
     the
     desired
     direction
     of
     travel,
     the
     robot
     can
     still
     move
     in
     the
     desired
     direction
     by
     steering
     these
     wheels.
     Because
     the
     vertical
     axis
     is
     offset
     from
     the
     ground
     contact
     path,
     the
     result
     of
     this
     steering
     motion
     is
     robot
     motion.

     <p class="noindent">
      In
     the
     research
     community,
     another
     classes
     of
     mobile
     robots
     are
     popular
     which
     achieve
     high
     maneuverability,
     only
     slightly
     inferior
     to
     that
     of
     the
     omnidirectional
     configurations.
     In
     such
     robots,
     motion
     in
     a
     particular
     direction
     may
     initially
     require
     a
     rotational
     motion.
     With
     a
     cir-
     cular
     chassis
     and
     an
     axis
     of
     rotation
     at
     the
     center
     of
     the
     robot,
     such
     a
     robot
     can
     spin
     without
     changing
     its
     ground
     footprint.
     The
     most
     popular
     such
     robot
     is
     the
     two-wheel
     differential
     drive
     robot
     where
     the
     two
     wheels
     rotate
     around
     the
     center
     point
     of
     the
     robot.
     One
     or
     two
     ad-
     ditional
     ground
     contact
     points
     may
     be
     used
     for
     stability,
     based
     on
     the
     application
     specifics.
     </p>
     <p class="noindent">
      In
     contrast
     to
     the
     above
     configurations,
     consider
     the
     Ackerman
     steering
     configuration
     com-
     mon
     in
     automobiles.
     Such
     a
     vehicle
     typically
     has
     a
     turning
     diameter
     that
     is
     larger
     than
     the
     car.
     Furthermore,
     for
     such
     a
     vehicle
     to
     move
     sideways
     requires
     a
     parking
     maneuver
     consist-
     ing
     of
     repeated
     changes
     in
     direction
     forward
     and
     backward.
     Nevertheless,
     Ackerman
     steer-
     ing
     geometries
     have
     been
     especially
     popular
     in
     the
     hobby
     robotics
     market,
     where
     a
     robot
     can
     be
     built
     by
     starting
     with
     a
     remote-control
     race
     car
     kit
     and
     adding
     sensing
     and
     autonomy
     to
     the
     existing
     mechanism.
     In
     addition,
     the
     limited
     maneuverability
     of
     Ackerman
     steering
     has
     an
     important
     advantage:
     its
     directionality
     and
     steering
     geometry
     provide
     it
     with
     very
     good
     lateral
     stability
     in
     high
     speed
     turns.

      Synchro
     Drive
     </h5>
     <p class="noindent">
      The
     synchro
     drive
     configuration
     (figure
     2.22)
     is
     a
     popular
     arrangement
     of
     wheels
     in
     indoor
     mobile
     robot
     applications.
     It
     is
     an
     interesting
     configuration
     because,
     although
     there
     are
     three
     driven
     and
     steered
     wheels,
     only
     two
     motors
     are
     used
     in
     total.
     The
     one
     translation
     motor
     sets
     the
     speed
     of
     all
     three
     wheels
     together,
     and
     the
     one
     steering
     motor
     spins
     all
     the
     wheels
     together
     about
     each
     of
     their
     individual
     vertical
     steering
     axes.
     But
     note
     that
     the
     wheels
     are
     being
     steered
     with
     respect
     to
     the
     robot
     chassis,
     and
     therefore
     there
     is
     no
     direct
     way
     of
     re-orienting
     the
     robot
     chassis.
     In
     fact,
     the
     chassis
     orientation
     does
     drift
     over
     time
     due
     to
     uneven
     tire
     slippage,
     causing
     rotational
     dead-reckoning
     error.
     </p>
     <p class="noindent">
      Synchro
     drive
     is
     particularly
     advantageous
     in
     cases
     where
     omnidirectionality
     is
     needed.
     So
     long
     as
     each
     vertical
     steering
     axis
     is
     aligned
     with
     the
     contact
     path
     of
     each
     tire,
     the
     robot
     can
     always
     re-orient
     its
     wheels
     and
     move
     along
     a
     new
     trajectory
     without
     changing
     its
     footprint.
     Of
     course,
     if
     the
     robot
     chassis
     has
     directionality
     and
     the
     designers
     intend
     to
     re-orient
     the
     chassis
     purposefully,
     then
     synchro
     drive
     is
     only
     appropriate
     when
     combined
     with
     an
     independently
     rotating
     turret
     that
     attaches
     to
     the
     wheel
     chassis.
     Commercial
     research
     robots
     such
     as
     the
     Nomadics
     150
     or
     the
     RWI
     B21r
     have
     been
     sold
     with
     this
     configuration
     (figure
     1.12).
     In
     terms
     of
     dead-reckoning,
     synchro
     drive
     systems
     are
     generally
     superior
     to
     true
     omni-directional
     configurations
     but
     inferior
     to
     differential
     drive
     and
     Ackerman
     steering
     systems.
     There
     are
     two
     main
     reasons
     for
     this.
     First
     and
     foremost,
     the
     translation
     motor
     generally
     drives
     the
     three
     wheels
     using
     a
     single
     belt.
     Due
     to
     slop
     and
     backlash
     in
     the
     drivetrain,
     whenever
     the
     drive
     motor
     engages,
     the
     closest
     wheel
     begins
     spinning
     before
     the
     furthest
     wheel,
     causing
     a
     small
     change
     in
     the
     orientation
     of
     the
     chassis.
     With
     additional
     changes
     in
     motor
     speed,
     these
     small
     angular
     shifts
     accumulate
     to
     create
     a
     large
     error
     in
     orientation
     during
     dead-reckoning.
     Second,
     the
     mobile
     robot
     has
     no
     direct
     control
     over
     the
     orientation
     of
     the
     chassis.
     Depending
     on
     the
     orientation
     of
     the
     chassis,
     the
     wheel
     thrust
     can
     be
     highly
     asymmetric,
     with
     two
     wheels
     on
     one
     side
     and
     the
     third
     wheel
     alone,
     or
     symmetric,
     with
     one
     wheel
     on
     each
     side
     and
     one
     wheel
     straight
     ahead
     or
     behind,
     as
     shown
     in
     (2.22).
     The
     asymmetric
     cases
     results
     in
     a
     variety
     of
     errors
     when
     tire-ground
     slippage
     can
     occur,
     again
     causing
     errors
     in
     dead-reckoning
     of
     robot
     orientation.

     later
     in
     chapter
     3.4.2,
     omnidirectional
     movement
     is
     be
     of
     great
     interest
     for
     complete
     maneuverability.
     Omnidirectional
     robots
     that
     are
     able
     to
     move
     in
     any
     direction
     (
     )
     at
     any
     time
     are
     also
     holonomic
     (see
     chapter
     3.4.2).
     They
     can
     be
     realized
     by
     either
     using
     spheric,
     castor
     or
     swedish
     wheels.
     Three
     examples
     of
     such

     <p class="noindent">
      The
     omnidirectional
     robot
     depicted
     in
     figure
     2.23
     is
     based
     on
     three
     spheric
     wheels,
     each
     ac-
     tuated
     by
     one
     motor.
     In
     this
     design,
     the
     spheric
     wheels
     are
     suspended
     by
     three
     contact
     points,
     two
     given
     by
     spherical
     bearings
     and
     one
     by
     the
     a

     provides
     excellent
     maneuverability
     and
     is
     simple

      Omnidirectional

     </h5>
     <p class="noindent">
      The
     omnidirectional
     arrangement
     depicted
     in
     figure
     2.24
     has
     been
     used
     successfully
     on
     sev-
     eral
     research
     robots,
     including
     the
     CMU
     Uranus.
     This
     configuration
     consists
     of
     four
     swedish
     45
     degree
     wheels,
     each
     driven
     by
     a
     separate
     motor.
     By
     varying
     the
     direction
     of
     rotation
     and
     relative
     speeds
     of
     the
     four
     wheels,
     the
     robot
     can
     be
     moved
     along
     any
     trajectory
     in
     the
     plane
     </p>
     <p class="noindent">
      and,
     even
     more
     impressively,
     can
     simultaneously
     spin
     around
     its
     vertical
     axis.
     For
     example,
     when
     all
     four
     wheels
     spin
     "forward"
     or
     "backward",
     the
     robot
     as
     a
     whole
     moves
     in
     a
     straight
     line
     forward
     and
     backward,
     respectively.
     However,
     when
     one
     diagonal
     pair
     of
     wheels
     is
     spun
     in
     the
     same
     direction
     and
     the
     other
     diagonal
     pair
     is
     spun
     in
     the
     opposite
     direction,
     the
     robot
     moves
     laterally.
     This
     four-wheel
     arrangement
     of
     swedish
     wheels
     is
     not
     minimal
     in
     terms
     of
     control
     motors.
     Because
     there
     are
     only
     3
     degrees
     of
     freedom
     in
     the
     plane,
     one
     can
     build
     a
     three-wheeled
     om-
     nidirectional
     robot
     chassis
     using
     three
     swedish
     90
     degree
     wheels
     as
     shown
     in
     Table
     2.1.
     However,
     existing
     examples
     such
     as
     Uranus
     have
     been
     designed
     with
     four
     wheels
     due
     to
     ca-
     pacity
     and
     stability
     considerations.
     One
     application
     for
     which
     such
     omnidirectional
     designs
     are
     particular
     amenable
     is
     mobile
     manipulation.
     In
     this
     case,
     it
     is
     desirable
     to
     reduce
     the
     degrees
     of
     freedom
     of
     the
     manipulator
     arm
     to

     As
     with
     humans,
     it
     would
     be
     ideal
     if
     the

     Locomotion
     </h5>
     <p class="noindent">
      In
     the
     wheel
     configurations
     discussed
     above,
     we
     have
     made
     the
     assumption
     that
     wheels
     are
     not
     allowed
     to
     skid
     against
     the
     surface.
     An
     alternative
     form
     of
     steering,
     termed
     slip/skid,
     may
     be
     used
     to
     re-orient
     the
     robot
     by
     spinning
     wheels
     that
     are
     facing
     the
     same
     direction
     at
     different
     speeds
     or
     in
     opposite
     directions.
     The
     army
     tank
     operates
     this
     way,
     and
     Nanokhod,
     pictured
     below
     (figure
     2.26)
     is
     an
     example
     of
     a
     mobile
     robot
     based
     on
     the
     same
     concept.
     Robots
     that
     make
     use
     of
     tread
     have
     much
     larger
     ground
     contact
     patches,
     and
     this
     can
     signif-
     icantly
     improve
     their
     maneuverability
     in
     loose
     terrain
     compared
     to
     conventional
     wheeled
     designs.
     However,
     due
     to
     this
     large
     ground
     contact
     patch,
     changing
     the
     orientation
     of
     the
     ro-
     bot
     usually
     requires
     a
     skidding
     turn,
     wherein
     a
     large
     portion
     of
     the
     track
     must
     slide
     against
     the
     terrain.
     The
     disadvantage
     of
     such
     configurations
     is
     coupled
     to
     the
     slip/skid
     steering.
     Because
     of
     the
     large
     amount
     of
     skidding
     during
     a
     turn,
     the
     exact
     center
     of
     rotation
     of
     the
     robot
     is
     hard
     to
     predict
     and
     the
     exact
     change
     in
     position
     and
     orientation
     is
     also
     subject
     to
     variations
     depend-
     ing
     on
     the
     ground
     friction.
     Therefore,
     dead-reckoning
     on
     such
     robots
     is
     highly
     inaccurate.
     This
     is
     the
     trade-off
     that
     is
     made
     in
     return
     for
     extremely
     good
     maneuverability
     and
     traction
     over
     rough
     and
     loose
     terrain.
     Furthermore,
     a
     slip/skid
     approach
     on
     a
     high-friction
     surface
     can
     quickly
     overcome
     the
     torque
     capabilities
     of
     the
     motors
     being
     used.
     In
     terms
     of
     power
     efficiency,
     this
     approach
     is
     reasonably
     efficient
     on
     loose
     terrain
     but
     extremely
     inefficient
     otherwise.

      Walking
     Wheels
     </h3>
     <p class="noindent">
      Walking robots might offer the best maneuverability in rough terrain. However, they are in- efficient on flat ground and need
     sophisticated control. Hybrid solutions, combining the adaptability of legs with the efficiency of wheels offer an interesting
     compromise. Solutions that passively adapt to the terrain are of particular interest for field and space robotics. The
     Sojourner robot of NASA/JPL (fig. 1.2) represents such a hybrid solution, able to overcome objects up to the size
     of the wheels. A more advanced mobile robot design for similar appli- cations has recently been produced by
     EPFL (fig. 2.27). This robot, called Shrimp2, has 6 motorized wheels and is capable of climbing objects up to two
     times its wheel diameter [84,85]. This enables it to climb regular stairs though the robot is even smaller than
     the So- journer. Using a rhombus configuration, the Shrimp has a steering wheel in the front and the rear, and
     two wheels arranged on a bogy on each side. The front wheel has a spring suspen- sion to guarantee optimal
     ground contact of all wheels at any time. The steering of the rover is realized by synchronizing the steering of the
     front and rear wheels and the speed differ- ence of the bogy wheels. This allows for high precision maneuvers and
     turning on the spot with minimum slip/skid of the four center wheels. The use of parallel articulations for the front
     wheel and the bogies creates a virtual center of rotation at the level of the wheel axis. This ensures maximum
     stability and climbing abilities even for very low friction coeffi- cients between the wheel and the ground. As mobile
     robotics research matures we find ourselves able to design more intricate me- chanical systems. At the same time,
     the control problems of inverse kinematics and dynam2 Locomotion 37 R. Siegwart, EPFL, Illah Nourbakhsh,
     CMU ics are now so readily conquered that these complex mechanics can in general be controlled. So, in the near
     future, you should expect to see a great number of unique, hybrid mobile ro- bots that draw together advantages
     from several of the underlying locomotion mechanisms that we have discussed in this chapter. They will each be
     technologically impressive, and each will be designed as the expert robot for its particular environmental niche.
